The Goat BotNet is a BotNet tool for pentesting discord servers by raid. The Goat is NOT a discord server nuker. It does not require a bot to be added or a webhook. This is a BotNet which means it uses REAL Discord Accounts to mass-spam a server. This tool can easily be countered by setting Slowmodes and locking down the channels which will cause a temporary outage in the server. The goal of a BotNet is to put the target at a outage and not completely destroy the target. Please remember that this is NOT a discord nuker.
